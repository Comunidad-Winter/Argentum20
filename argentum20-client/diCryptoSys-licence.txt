CryptoSys (tm) API for Windows Developer Licence Agreement

This is a legal document. Please read these terms carefully before
installing the Software as installation or use will indicate your
acceptance to all of the terms of this licence agreement.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

D.I. Management Services Pty Limited ABN 78 083 210 584 ("the Author")
is willing to license the enclosed 'CryptoSys API' software and
documentation ("the Software") to you only upon the condition that you
accept all of the terms contained in this licence agreement.

The Author hereby grants you a single non-exclusive, non-transferable
licence to use the Software as a developer tool in accordance with
these terms.

The Software is a development tool that provides a programming
interface to cryptographic functions. You may NOT use the Software to
develop another cryptographic programming interface or as a
component of one.

Provided your application's main purpose is not merely providing a
programming interface to cryptographic functions, you may include
the following executable files either as part of your own 
applications for installation on your client's computers or in your
own in-house applications:

1. diCryptoSys.dll
2. diCrSysAPINet.dll
3. diCryptOCX.dll

Only these executable files may be distributed to others or used as
part of in-house applications, and they must be distributed as an
integral part of your own application, not separately. There is no
limit on the number of end users you may distribute it to in this
manner. 

This licence permits you to use the Software as a developer tool by
one (1) developer on one (1) computer only. Use as a developer tool on
more than one computer or by more than one developer requires the
purchase of separate licences for each separate computer or developer.

This licence is issued only to the original purchaser of the Software
and cannot be transferred or assigned.

You are not permitted to copy, sell, rent, lease, sub-licence or lend
the Software to any third parties except under the terms of this 
licence. The documentation may not be distributed or shared in any 
manner.

Your end users and any other third party gain no rights whatsoever 
to use or distribute the executables except as an integral part of 
your application.

You must keep your licence ID number confidential and must not divulge
it to or make it available to any third party.

The copyright in and title to all intellectual property rights in the
Software and related documentation remain with the Author at all
times.

Without prejudice to any other rights, the Author may terminate this
licence if you do not observe its terms and conditions. In such an
event, you must destroy all copies of the Software.

The Author makes no representations concerning either the
merchantability of the Software or its suitability for any particular
purpose. It is provided "AS IS" without express or implied warranty of
any kind. Because of the various hardware and software environments
into which software may be put, no warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose is offered. Good data processing procedure dictates
that any software be thoroughly tested with non-critical data before
relying on it.

In no event shall the Author be liable for any damages in connection
with or arising out of the use of the Software by any person
whatsoever, including incidental, indirect, special or consequential
damages, or any damages related to loss of use, revenue or profits,
even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. By using the Software you EXPRESSLY AGREE to such a waiver.

This licence shall be governed and interpreted by the laws of
Australia without regard to your choice of legal jurisdiction, and you
expressly agree that the venue for resolution of disputes, if any,
arising out of this licence or the performance of the Software, shall
be in Australia.

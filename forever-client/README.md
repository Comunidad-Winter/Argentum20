# Coding conventions
These are some initial code conventions to mantain a coherent style.

All names for classes, methods and functions must be in **english**

## Variable classes, methods and types
Variable names should be **UpperCamelCase**, also referred as **PascalCase**

Names always start with an uppercase letter. No use of spaces or underscore. Use an uppercase letter to start each words. Names must be meaningful and help the reader to understand the code. Don't use names like: test, prueba, etc.

## Local variables
All variable names **MUST BE IN ENGLISH**. Must be meaningful and help to understand the code.
There is more freedom, they can be lowercase and use special chars like _

## Constants

Names for constants must be *uppercase*. For example: HEALTH is good, but not Health nor health.

## Members
Member variables in classes must start with **m** to hint member of a class. For example mHealth is correct. Members must not start with _ or any other lower case letter different from m
